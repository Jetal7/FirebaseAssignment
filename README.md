Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server
development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Like Firebase Realtime Database, it
keeps your data in sync across client apps through real time listeners and offers
offline support for mobile and web so you can build responsive apps that work
regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers
seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud products, including
Cloud Functions.
